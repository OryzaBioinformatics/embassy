The EMBOSS-Associated (EMBASSY) packages are a suite of individual
packages that are built using EMBOSS libraries and run with all the
features of EMBOSS applications.

Some packages are adapted code to add the EMBOSS command line
interface and to use EMBOSS output functions. Other packages are
EMBOSS fron-ends to separately installed native packages.

The licenses for each package are described in the the package
directory.

The EMBOSS libraries they link to are licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License Version 2.1.
