Function

   Predict RNA duplex (hybridization) sites and structure

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAduplex.

   It reads two RNA sequences and computes optimal and suboptimal
   secondary structures for their hybridization. The calculation is
   simplified by allowing only inter-molecular base pairs, for the general
   case use ovrnacfold. The computed optimal and suboptimal structure are
   output. It is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure
   between a small probe sequence and a long target sequence.

Algorithm

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/
