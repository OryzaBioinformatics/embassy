Function

   Calculate energy of RNA sequences with a given secondary structure

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAeval.

   It evaluates the free energy of an RNA molecule in fixed secondary
   structure. Sequences and structures are read and the energy in Kcal/Mol
   is written.

   The original program has additional inputs and produces different
   outputs, depending on the options selected. In the EMBASSY
   implementation it is split into ovrnaeval and ovrnaevalpair

Algorithm

   The program will continue to read new sequences and structures until a
   line consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition
   is encountered.

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/
