Function

   Plot vrnafold output

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAplot.

   It reads the output of ovrnafold (RNA sequences and structures) and
   produces drawings of the secondary structure graph.

Algorithm

   The coordinates are produced using either E. Bruccoleri's naview
   routines, or a simple radial layout method.

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/
