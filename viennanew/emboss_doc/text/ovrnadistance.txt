Function

   Calculate distances between RNA secondary structures

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAdistance.

   It reads RNA secondary structures and calculates one or more measures
   for their dissimilarity, based on tree or string editing (alignment).
   In addition it calculates a "base pair distance" given by the number of
   base pairs present in one structure, but not the other. For structures
   of different length base pair distance is not recommended.

Algorithm

   RNAdistance accepts structures in bracket format, where matching
   brackets symbolize base pairs and unpaired bases are represented by a
   dot ".", or coarse grained representations where hairpins, interior
   loops, bulges, multiloops, stacks and external bases are represented by
   (H), (I), (B), (M), (S), and (E), respectively. These can be optionally
   weighted. Full structures can be represented in the same fashion using
   the identifiers (U) and (P) for unpaired and paired bases,
   respectively.

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

   The program will continue to read new structures until a line
   consisting of the single character @ or an end of file condition is
   encountered. Input lines neither containing a valid structure nor
   starting with > are ignored.
