Function

   Calculate min. energy RNA structure / pair probabilities

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAfold.

   It reads RNA sequences, calculates their minimum free energy (mfe)
   structure and output the mfe structure in bracket notation and its free
   energy. It produces plots of the resulting secondary structure graph
   and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix. It also computes the
   partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix, and
   outputs the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, the frequency of
   the mfe structure in the ensemble, and the ensemble diversity.

   The original program has additional inputs and produces different
   outputs, depending on the options selected. In the EMBASSY
   implementation it is split into ovrnafold for a single sequence and
   ovrnafoldpair for a pair of sequences See the original documentation
   for the Vienna RNA package http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/
