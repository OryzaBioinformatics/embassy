Function

   Find RNA sequences with a given secondary structure

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAinverse.

   It searches for sequences folding into a predefined structure, thereby
   inverting the folding algorithm. Target structures (in bracket
   notation) and starting sequences for the search are read.

Algorithm

   Characters in the start sequence other than "AUGC" (or the alphabet
   specified with -a) are treated as wild cards and replaced by a random
   character. Any lower case characters in the start sequence are kept
   fixed during the search. If necessary, the sequence will be elongated
   to the length of the structure. Thus a string of "N"s as well as a
   blank line specify a random start sequence.

   For each search the best sequence found and its Hamming distance to the
   start sequence are output. If the the search was unsuccessful, a
   structure distance to the target is appended. Optionally the output
   format can be modified.

   The program will continue to read new structures and sequences until a
   line consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition
   is encountered.
