Function

   Calculate secondary structures of RNA dimers

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAcofold.

   It reads two RNA sequences wich are then allowed to form a dimer
   structure, calculates their minimum free energy (mfe) dimer structure
   and output the mfe structure in bracket notation and its free energy.
   It produces plots of the resulting secondary structure graph and a "dot
   plot" of the base pairing matrix.

   The original program has additional inputs and produces different
   outputs, depending on the options selected. In the EMBASSY
   implementation it is split into ovrnacofold ovrnacofoldconc and
   ovrnacofoldpf
